# River-Non_river-classification-using-Bayes-Classifier
Given 4 satellite images of Kolkata, having different wavelength (Red (band1.gif), Green (band2.gif), Blue (band3.gif) and Infrared (band3.gif)). Collect 50 sample points from river area and 100 sample points from non-river area with equal distribution. For each pixel location x,y you will get 4 dimensional feature values: (R, G, B and Ir). Hence for river class you will get 4X50, and for non-river class you will get 4X100 feature points. 
Training Set: River Class (50 samples)	 
              Non-River Class (100 Samples)
Testing Set: All four images
